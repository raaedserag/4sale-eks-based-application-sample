# 4Sale EKS Infrastructure Challenge

The DevOps team at 4sale is responsible for AWS cloud infrastructure and security, engaging with developers to apply DevOps practices throughout SDLC like high-level system design, automation, and CI/CDs, and finally our ownership over production systems for monitoring and alerting and on-call activities.

We understand you have a personal life, so please take one whole week to finish this challenge. We're all about MVP (Minimum Viable Product). We will be happy by you deliver version zero of this project. We want to see how you approach the problem, not that you write the most perfect code in the world.

We love answering questions. Please send us your questions at the email address we sent you the challenge. We're happy to help!

Also, we understand this is an infrastructure challenge, and we've tried to make the application easy to manage. It's containerized, so starting the app should be as simple as running the container. We're more than happy to help with roadblocks here. Additionally, if you need to modify the application itself in any way, feel free to fork it and do so!
